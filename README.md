# Complete Guide: Using the Neural Compute Stick 2
## 1) Setting up virtual environment
In order to get the Neural Compute Stick 2 working, it is strongly recommended that you use a fresh install of Ubuntu on a virtual environment. (I couldn't get Movidius working on my main machine even with Ubtuntu). 

First, download VirtualBox on your host machine

`sudo apt-get install virtualbox`
